# Brief
This is project is a prototype of an intelligent baby care system. And this android APP is designed for the user to interact with the whole system.

At the first time, the user would be lead to a page that can select the wifi AP from the IOT device. After set up the configuration, the first page would list all devices that user had connected.

If the user choose one of the device, it would transfer to the second page and the picture would show the state of the baby. Click the button on the right bottom, it would show the list for all events that had been recorded. The EMERGENCY means that the baby is climbing out the crib. 

If user want to see how baby sleep well or not, click the WAKEUP event and it would show the information during this sleep.
